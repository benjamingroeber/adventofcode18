# Advent of Code 2018
This is my first year participating at the Advent of Code.

I decided to solve the problems in Rust to improve my knowledge about
the language (specifically the functional interfaces) and possibly learn 
myself some new Rust concepts.

My self proclaimed goals for this year are:
* idiomatic code
* try to use functional interfaces
* avoid panics
* formulate the examples as test cases
